A.) Now redo the proof, but assume E(u|X) = 0.65
 What bias do you get?
 Proof you answer by showing it in the proof.

TBD

B.) Write down all 4 sources of endogeneity.

1. Omitted Variable; 2. Selection bias; 3. Measurement error; 4. Simultaneity. 


C.) Below is a Haiku that describes a situation where endogeneity biased the estimation result.
Which source of endogeneity does it refer to?

Selection bias.

D.) Try to think of 2 (or up to 4 if you want to do one for each source) examples/regressions where an important source of endogeneity is likely to bias an OLS-estimation. Briefly describe it in a few lines. (hint: a Haiku (3 lines with 5-7-5 syllables; See below for an example) that describes it).

1. Omitted Variable:
Regressed English test score on age.
Found that only few people learn quickly.
But language spoken at home was forgotten.

2. Selection bias:
Regressed training on finding job
Found that training leads to better job.
But non-motivated didn't sign up for training.

3. Measurement error:
Regressed weight on health outcomes 
Found that underweight didn't cause bad health.
But the weighing machine was inaccurate.

4. Simultaneity:
Regressed drug use on depression.
Found that drugs cause depression.
But depression leads to drug-use.

E.) Regression Exercises
